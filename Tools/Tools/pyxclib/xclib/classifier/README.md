# Implementation of basic extreme multi-label classifiers
1. OVAClassifier
    One-vs-all support vector classifier
2. KCentroidClassifier
    Labels are represented as document centroids
3. KNeighborsClassifier
    KNN-classifier
4. Slice
    Refer to http://manikvarma.org/pubs/jain19.pdf
5. MIPS
    Approximation of OVA prediction via Minimum inner product search
 
# TODO
[] test: distributed training for OVA
